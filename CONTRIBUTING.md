## Contributing Code

Thanks a lot for spending your time on Impostor! Please follow these guidelines
when contributing code:

- Please open an issue before starting work on a pull request. This will help
  avoid duplicate work, and will help us make sure that your contribution fits
  in with Impostor's goals and philosophy. Your PR may be closed without review
  if you don't open an issue first!
- Please make sure that your code passes the tests and lints. The CI should
  catch this, but ideally you know your code will pass before you submit it.
- Please add tests for any new functionality you add. If you're fixing a bug,
  please add a test that reproduces the bug.

At the end of the day, we're all human, and we'll work with you to make sure
your contribution is accepted. If we don't get around to your PR on time, please
don't take it personally, and feel free to ping us on the PR after an
appropriate amount of time has passed.

Also, feel free to ask for help at any time!
